# TUPLES
# ordered collection of items
# immutable
# cannot update/remove from it

tuple_example = (1,2,3)

# why use tuple
# faster and lighter weight than a list
# tuples are valid keys in a dictionary, unlike a list, a key of a coordinate location is a good example

# EXAMPLE of a good tuple
# would be the months of the year
# you don't need to ever change the months
